# Kaya
The Kaya OS Project
The Queues Manager

 

1  Introduction
In this phase you will implement Level 2 of the Kaya OS; The Queues Manager. The specification for this level is in the Student Guide to the Kaya Operating System Project. You are expected to follow the guidelines set forth both in the µMPS2 Principles of Operation and the Implementing Modules in C documentation.

 
There are a number of important provided files.

const.h - contains hardware-related constants,
types.h - contains type-definitions for µMPS2.
p1test.c - is a provided test file for this phase.
P1-Makefile - a sample Makefile for this project.
You should copy these files into your own directory and make additions (and deletions) as you see fit.
Rename P1-Makefile to simply Makefile, and put the .h files into your own h/ directory.


These files can all be found in ~mikeyg/opSys/kaya/ on cerebro.cs.xu.edu

 
2  Testing and Submission of Code
 
The test program reports on its progress by adding messages to the buffers okbuf and errbuf in addition to displaying these same messages on TERMINAL0.

 
Here is what the output from a successful run should look like.
 
 
You are to submit both hardcopies and electronic copies of all of your code.

Please submit via email all the files necessary for complete instructor testing. (i.e. All .c, .e and .h files in addition to your Makefile.)
